\section{EURAXESS-Helpful information for researchers in Luxembourg}
In fact, the Luxembourg government does provide official documents, i.e. guide-euraxess and JustArrived, that contain lots more official information as you can see here.

The document, namely Guide Euraxess \cite{Euraxess}, published in 2012, is \textit{edited by the EURAXESS Services Centre Luxembourg and co-financed by the European Commission, which will guide researchers from all over the world who wish to work in Luxembourg.
The aim is to make your mobility experience as easy as possible, by presenting an overview of the legal framework in matters such as employment, entry conditions, taxation, social security, health care, as well as to provide information on accommodation and daily life, so that you can get the most from Luxembourg’s research landscape} -- The Minister of Education.
