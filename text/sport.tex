\subsection{Self-organised sport clubs at SnT}
 
There are sport activities organised by people at SnT. These activities are normally organised in an ad-hoc manner so just talk to people and you may find out many common minds.

We have a group playing soccer weekly and we participate in the annual Uni Soccer Cup organised in summer. For more info, please contact Marjan Skrobot (\href{mailto:Marjan.Skrobot@uni.lu}{Marjan.Skrobot@uni.lu}).
