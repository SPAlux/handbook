\section{Buying/getting (second-hand) furniture}

Buying furniture: to buy new furniture, you may go to IKEA in Arlon, Belgium or IKEA in Metz, France.
There is no IKEA in Luxembourg, but other big, comparable furniture stores like \url{http://www.alvisse.lu}. 

To buy second-hand furniture, you may go to some websites like \url{http://luxembourg.angloinfo.com/information}
or Your Trash, My Treasure Facebook page, or \url{http://www.troc.com/en/}. 

You may want to rent a van to carry big furniture. 
It must be much cheaper than paying for the services from IKEA or Troc. 
See the section about renting a car/van.  

Getting furniture for free! For example, check the Free Your Stuff Luxembourg Facebook page
