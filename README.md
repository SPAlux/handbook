SPA Handbook
============

ABSTRACT: This is a document initiated by the SnT PhD student Association (SPA for short) in order to provide some practical information about working and living in Luxembourg for newcomers joining SnT. It does not represent an official position and is selective by its nature, based on what our SnTers have experienced since arriving, living, and working in Luxembourg. This document is to be kept up-to-date and enriched by people in our research centre with their own (new) experiences so it would be useful for anyone interested, especially newcomers in Luxembourg.
